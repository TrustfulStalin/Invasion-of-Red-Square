Introducing a satirical masterpiece: "Red Square Defense." This game offers a unique twist on the classic Space Invaders format, transforming the iconic Red Square into a battleground against an undead onslaught. Players assume the role of the esteemed leader of Russia, Joseph Stalin, tasked with defending the motherland from the relentless zombie horde.

Restricted to horizontal movement and armed solely with the ability to fire, players must strategically eliminate approaching zombies before they breach the defenses and reach Joseph Stalin. As players progress and achieve set scoring milestones, a cascade of propaganda elements celebrates their triumphs, reinforcing the game's thematic depth.

Crafted meticulously using CSS, JavaScript, and HTML, "Red Square Defense" is a testament to creativity and technical prowess. It's important to note that while the game is intended as a comedic endeavor, it stands as a testament to the creator's artistic expression and does not espouse any specific political ideologies or viewpoints.
